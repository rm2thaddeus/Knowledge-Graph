# Minimum Viable Product Room Guide

## Purpose
Translate validated PoC learnings into a cohesive product that delivers end-user value. Follow the structured escalation path promoted in the 2025 agent-native development research to keep MVP scope disciplined.

## Key Responsibilities
- Define feature slices with measurable outcomes and user stories.
- Maintain prioritized backlog and acceptance criteria.
- Record UX/UI decisions, including wireframes or component guidelines.
- Coordinate with engineering to track implementation status and risks.

## Documentation Expectations
Each entry (e.g., feature spec) should include:
- Metadata (author, date, phase: MVP, status).
- User problem and persona.
- Scope boundaries and dependencies.
- Acceptance tests or telemetry goals.
- Rollout and feedback plan.

## Guardrails
- Protect core timeline: defer nice-to-have features to a parking lot section.
- Ensure accessibility and performance considerations are captured early.
- Cross-reference `docs/poc-room/transition-log.md` to confirm all PoC learnings are addressed.

## Exit Criteria for Production Promotion
1. MVP success metrics are met or baselined.
2. Support playbooks and analytics requirements are documented.
3. Outstanding risks have mitigation owners.
