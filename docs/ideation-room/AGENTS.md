# Ideation Room Agent Charter

## Purpose
Support divergent thinking, problem discovery, and opportunity sizing before implementation begins. Follow the 2025 agent-native workflow by capturing structured prompts and evidence while keeping decisions traceable.

## Responsibilities
- Document user pains, market research, and success metrics hypotheses.
- Generate SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) narratives to shape discovery.
- Record stakeholder interviews or references that inspired the initiative.

## Deliverables
Every entry should contain:
- Metadata block (author, date, phase: Ideation, status).
- Problem statement + evidence.
- Proposed experiments or prototypes.
- Links to supporting research or datasets.

## Guardrails
- Do not commit raw personally identifiable information; anonymize sources.
- Flag risky assumptions and knowledge gaps for validation in the PoC phase.
- Avoid implementation details—store those in later phases.

## Recommended Prompts
- Use `../templates/research-prompt.yaml` when kicking off new topics.
- Summarize opportunities with a one-line pitch and top three risks.

## Exit Criteria
Before work graduates to the PoC room, ensure the idea has:
1. A validated problem statement.
2. Minimum success criteria.
3. Initial acceptance by maintainers or stakeholders.
